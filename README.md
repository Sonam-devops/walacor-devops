# WALACOR – DevOps Infrastructure Project

This is a case study of the infrastructure and DevOps automation I built for the WALACOR enterprise data security platform, during my work with Binary Informatics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

[Walacor](https://www.walacor.com/) is an enterprise-grade platform for secure, quantum-safe data storage and auditability. I worked as a DevOps Engineer to automate infrastructure and enable CI/CD deployment using AWS and Docker.
